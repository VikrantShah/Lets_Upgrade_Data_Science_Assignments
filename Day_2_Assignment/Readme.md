# Assignment 2

<br><br>
## Questions 1:
Create an empty list. Accept 10 numbers from the user and append to it the list if it is an even number.

<br><br>
## Questions 2:
Create a notebook on LIST COMPREHENSION. This exercise is to put you in a Self learning mode

## Question 3:
You have seen in the videos how powerful dictionary data structure is.

In this assignment, given a number n, you have to write a program that generates a dictionary d which contains (i, i*i), where i is from 1 to n (both included). Then you have to just print this dictionary d.

#### Example:
Input: 4 <br>
will give output as <br>
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16} <br>
Input Format: <br>
Take the number n in a single line. <br>
Output Format: <br>
Print the dictionary d in a single line. <br>

#### Example:
Input: <br>
8 <br>
Output: <br>
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

## Questions 4:
There is a robot which wants to go the charging point to charge itself.

The robot moves in a 2-D plane from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with given steps.

The trace of robot movement is shown as the following: <br>
UP 5 <br>
DOWN 3 <br>
LEFT 3 <br>
RIGHT 2 <br>
Then, the output of the program should be: <br>
2 <br>
The numbers after the direction are steps. 

Write a program to compute the distance between the current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer (use round() function for that and then convert it into an integer).

#### Input Format:
The first line of the input contains a number n which implies the number of directions to be given. <br>
The next n lines contain the direction and the step separated by a space.

#### Output Format:
Print the distance from the original position to the current position.

#### Example:
Input: <br>
4 <br>
UP 5 <br>
DOWN 3 <br>
LEFT 3 <br>
RIGHT 2 <br>
Output: <br>
2
